## Software Tool: User Interface Builder
For this assignment select and exercise a software tool that supports the construction of user computer interfaces. Work with this tool on some simple applications or examples and write a description of the tool's main characteristics and applicability.

Indicate the selected tool's name, the company that produces it, the current status of the tool, and its availability. Then, describe its main functions, organization, capabilities, and intended areas of applications. Briefly describe the simple applications or examples on which you exercised the tool.

Using a set of at least five evaluation criteria (not necessarily the five usability measures from Chapter 1) of your choice, indicate your personal opinions on the tool and provide recommendations for its potential users. Have a score range (e.g., 1 to 5 stars) and justify your score for each criterion. To give an idea of the "look and feel" of the selected HCI tool you should also include at least four snapshots of the tool "in action", with associated descriptions.

Examples of possible tools include but are not limited to: Microsoft Visual Studio, Adobe Dreamweaver, Arcad Application Builder, Python WXGlade, Apple Xcode IDE, QT Designer GUI Builder, Game Maker, Blender, Hammer World Editor, Carrara Studio, Genesis32, Invision Studio, Adobe XD, Bootstrap Studio, Marvel, Unity Pro.
