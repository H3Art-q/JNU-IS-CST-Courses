## Exercise 4.2 (optional)
Prove that decryption in a Feistel cipher can be done by applying the encryption algorithm to the ciphertext, with the key schedule reversed.

> **Solution**:
> 
> Since Data Encryption Standard (DES) has the core idea about Feistel Cipher, the analysis of DES can be applied to any Feistel cipher.
> 
> Therefore, we take DES as an example to prove decryption in Feistel Cipher can be done by applying the encryption algorithm to the ciphertext, DES encryption procedure has 16 rounds as follows:
> 
> $$
> \begin{align}
>     L_0R_0 &= \text{Initial Permutation}(x) \nonumber\\
>     L_1 &= R_0 \nonumber\\
>     R_1 &= L_0 \oplus f(R_0, K_1) \nonumber
> \end{align}
> $$
> 
> where $x$ is the plaintext, $\text{IP}(x)$ is divided into two halves of equal length, namely $L$ and $R$, the round function $g$ has the following form $g(L_{i-1}, R_{i-1}, K_{i}) = (L_i, R_i)$, where:
> 
> $$
> \begin{align}
>     L_i &= R_{i-1} \nonumber\\
>     R_i &= L_{i-1} \oplus f(R_{i-1}, K_i) \nonumber
> \end{align}
> $$
> 
> After $16$ iterations and invert permutation, we obtain the DES encrypted ciphertext $y$:
> 
> $$
> \begin{align}
>     L_{16} &= R_{15} \nonumber\\
>     R_{16} &= L_{15} \oplus f(R_{15}, K_{16}) \nonumber\\
>     y &= \text{Initial Permutation}^{-1}(R_{16}L_{16}) \nonumber
> \end{align}
> $$
> 
> Nextly, we need to decrypt the ciphertext $y$ based on Feistel Cipher idea:
> 
> $$
> \begin{align}
>     L_0'R_0' &= \text{Initial Permutation}(y) = R_{16}L_{16} \nonumber\\
>     L_1' &= R_0' = L_{16} = R_{15} \nonumber\\
>     R_1' &= L_0' \oplus f(R_0', K_{16}) = R_{16} \oplus f(R_{15}, K_{16}) = L_{15} \nonumber\\
>     \vdots \nonumber\\
>     L_{16}' &= R_{15}' = L_1 = R_0 \nonumber\\
>     R_{16}' &= L_{15}' \oplus f(R_{15}', K_1) = R_1 \oplus f(R_{0}, K_1) = L_0 \nonumber\\
> \end{align}
> $$
>
> $$
> \text{Initial Permutation}^{-1}(R_{16}'L_{16}') = \text{Initial Permutation}^{-1}(L_0R_0) = x
> $$
> 
> Finally, in $16$ rounds of DES we can prove decryption in a Feistel cipher can be done by applying the encryption algorithm to the ciphertext, with the key schedule reversed. If necessary, we can prove by induction that more rounds of Feistel cipher are also true.

## Exercise 4.3
Let $DES(x,K)$ represent the encryption of plaintext $x$ with key $K$ using the DES cryptosystem. Suppose $y = DES(x, K)$ and $y' = DES(c(x), c(K))$, where $c(\cdot)$ denotes the bitwise complement of its argument. Prove that $y' = c(y)$ (i.e., if we complement the plaintext and the key, then the ciphertext is also complemented). Note that this can be proved using only the "high-level" description of $DES$â€”the actual structure of S-boxes and other components of the system are irrelevant.

> **Solution**:
> 
> Suppose $y = DES(x, K)$ and $y' = DES(c(x), c(K))$, according to DES procedure we know that every stage of encryption is as follows:
> 
> $$
> \begin{align}
>   L_{i+1} &= R_i \nonumber\\
>   R_{i+1} &= L_i \oplus f(R_i, K_i) \nonumber
> \end{align}
> $$
> 
> We omit the $\text{Initial Permutation}$, for $DES(L_0R_0, K)$, define $L_0' = c(L_0)$, $R_0' = c(R_0)$ and $K_i' = c(K_i)$, these definitions lead to $DES(L_0'R_0', K')$, nextly we will prove that for any stage $L_i' = c(L_i)$ and $R_i' = c(R_i)$ by induction, namely we can prove $y' = c(y)$.
> 
> **Base case**, when $i = 1$:
> 
> For $DES(L_0R_0, K)$, 
> 
> $$
> \begin{align}
>   L_1 &= R_0 \nonumber\\
>   R_1 &= L_0 \oplus f(R_0, K_0) \nonumber
> \end{align}
> $$
> 
> For $DES(L_0'R_0', K_0')$, 
> 
> $$
> \begin{align}
>   L_1' &= R_0' \nonumber\\
>   R_1' &= L_0' \oplus f(R_0', K_0') \nonumber\\
>   &= c(L_0) \oplus f(c(R_0), c(K_0)) \nonumber
> \end{align}
> $$
> 
> Since $f(R_i, K_i)$ uses the $\oplus$ operation to combine input bits of $R_i$ (after expansion) and $K_i$ before the permutation in S-boxes, and $\oplus$ is associative and communtative, 
> 
> $$
> c(r) \oplus c(k) = r \oplus k
> $$
> 
> therefore, $R_1' = c(L_0 \oplus f(R_0, K_0)) = c(R_1)$
> 
> **Induction step**, when $i > 1$:
> 
> For $DES(L_0R_0, K)$, 
> 
> $$
> \begin{align}
>   L_n &= R_{n-1} \nonumber\\
>   R_n &= L_{n-1} \oplus f(R_{n-1}, K_{n-1}) \nonumber
> \end{align}
> $$
> 
> For $DES(L_0'R_0', K)$, 
> 
> $$
> \begin{align}
>   L_n' &= R_{n-1}' = c(R_{n-1}) \nonumber\\
>   R_n' &= L_{n-1}' \oplus f(R_{n-1}', K_{n-1}') \nonumber\\
>   &= c(L_{n-1}) \oplus f(c(R_{n-1}), c(K_{n-1})) \nonumber\\
>   &= c(L_{n-1} \oplus f(R_{n-1}, K_{n-1})) \nonumber
> \end{align}
> $$
> 
> Therefore, after $16$ stages of Feistel Cipher in DES, we can finally get $L_{16}' = c(L_{16})$ and $R_{16}' = c(R_{16})$, we concatenate $L_{16}'$ and $R_{16}'$, can obtain:
> 
> $$
> y' = L_{16}'R_{16}' = c(L_{16}R_{16}) = c(y)
> $$

## Exercise 4.4 (optional)
Suppose that we have the following 128-bit AES key, given in hexadecimal notation:

$$
\text{2B7E151628AED2A6ABF7158809CF4F3C}
$$

Construct the complete key schedule arising from this key.

> **Solution**:
> 
> To expand a given 128-bit initial key to derive the full-length key for AES encryption, the following steps need to be performed:
> 
> - **Initial Key Setup**: The initial 128-bit key is used as the encryption key for the first round.
> - **Structure of Key Expansion**: For a 128-bit key, there are a total of 10 rounds, and thus, 10 round keys are needed.
> - **Concept of Words**: In AES key expansion, the key is divided into several 32-bit units called "words". For a 128-bit key, there are initially 4 words.
> - **Key Expansion Algorithm**:
>    - **RotWord Operation**: This involves a simple byte rotation within a word (e.g., $ [a0, a1, a2, a3] $ becomes $ [a1, a2, a3, a0] $).
>    - **SubWord Operation**: This operation applies an S-box substitution to each byte of the word after the RotWord operation.
>    - **Rcon Operation**: During the generation of the first word of each new 128-bit block of the key, a round constant (Rcon) is used. This is a predefined series of values in AES, used to add complexity through an XOR operation.
> - **Generating Additional Words**: New key words are generated through the operations mentioned above and by XORing with the previous complete key block. This process is repeated until enough round keys are generated. For a 128-bit key, a total of 44 words are needed (initial 4 words plus 40 additional words for the 10 rounds).

## Exercise 4.6 (for the case of CBC mode)
Prove that decryption in CBC mode or CFB mode can be parallelized efficiently. More precisely, suppose we have $n$ ciphertext blocks and $n$ processors. Show that it is possible to decrypt all $n$ ciphertext blocks in constant time.

> **Solution**:
> 
> Suppose we are given $n$ ciphertext blocks $y_1,\dots,y_n$, and we have $n$ processors $P_1,\dots,P_n$.
> 
> For CBC mode, in the first step, each $P_i$ decrypts $y_i$, obtaining the intermediate state obtained by XORing the plaintext block with the initial vector or the previous ciphertext block, we denote it as $z_i$. 
> 
> In the next step, each $P_i$ computes $z_i \oplus y_i$ can finally get the plaintext blocks $x_i$.

## Exercise 4.8 (for the case of CFB mode)
Suppose that $X = (x_1,\dots,x_n)$ and $X' = (x'_1,\dots,x'_n)$ are two sequences of $n$ plaintext blocks. Define

$$
\textbf{same}(X, X') = \max\{j:x_i=x_i'\text{ for all }i\leq j\}
$$

Suppose $X$ and $X'$ are encrypted in CBC or CFB mode using the same key and the same IV. Show that it is easy for an adversary to compute $\textbf{same}(X,X')$.

> **Solution**:
>
> In CFB mode, consider two ciphertexts, $Y = (y_1,\dots,y_n)$ and $Y' = (y_1',\dots,y_n')$, corresponding to plaintexts $X$ and $X'$. Assume that $x_i = x_i'$ for $1 \leq i \leq j$, but $x_{j+1} \neq x_{j+1}'$. This implies that $y_i = y_i'$ for all $1 \leq i \leq j$, and $y_{j+1} \neq y_{j+1}'$. Therefore, the adversary can determine:
> 
> $$
> \textbf{same}(X,X') = \max\{j : y_i = y_i' \text{ for all } i \leq j\}
> $$

## Exercise 4.9 (for the case of OFB mode)
Suppose that $X = (x_1,\dots,x_n)$ and $X' = (x_1,\dots,x_n)$ are two sequences of $n$ plaintext blocks. Suppose $X$ and $X'$ are encrypted in OFB mode using the same key and the same IV. Show that it is easy for an adversary to compute $X\oplus X'$.Show that a similar result holds for CTR mode if $ctr$ is reused.

> **Solution**:
> 
> Consider $Y$ and $Y'$ as the ciphertexts of $X$ and $X'$, respectively, both encrypted using the same keystream. In encryption, the plaintexts are combined with the keystream using the XOR operation to produce the ciphertexts. Therefore, the result of XOR-ed $Y$ and $Y'$ directly gives the XOR of $X$ and $X'$, expressed as: 
> 
> $$
> \begin{align}
>   Y \oplus Y' &= (X \oplus K) \oplus (X' \oplus K) \nonumber\\
>   &= X \oplus X' \oplus (K \oplus K) \nonumber\\
>   &= X \oplus X' \oplus 0 \nonumber\\
>   &= X \oplus X' \nonumber
> \end{align}
> $$
