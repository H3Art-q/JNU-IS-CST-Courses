## Chapter 9: Analysis of Two-Way Tables

### 9.1 Inference for Two-Way Tables

**Two-Way Tables（双向表）** can be used to describe the **relationship** between **two categorical variables**. 
- When the data are obtained from random sampling, two-way tables of counts can be used to formally **test the hypothesis** that the two categorical variables are **independent** in the population from which the data were obtained.

To test this hypothesis, we compare **actual counts（实际计数）** from the sample data with **expected counts（预期计数）**, the expected count in any cell of a two-way table when $H_0$ is true is:

$$
\textbf{expected count} = \frac{\textbf{row total}\times\textbf{column total}}{n}
$$

where $\textbf{row total}$ represents **the sum of a cell row（单元格所在行的计数和）**, $\textbf{column total}$ represents **the sum of a cell column（单元格所在列的计数和）**

The **test statistic** that makes the comparison is the **chi-square statistic（卡方统计量）**, the chi-square statistic is a measure of **how far the observed counts are from the expected counts（检验观察值和期望值的差距）**. The formula for the statistic is:

$$
\mathcal{X}^2 = \sum\frac{(\textbf{observed} - \textbf{expected})^2}{\textbf{expected}}
$$

where $\textbf{observed}$ represents **an observed cell count（一个单元格的值）**

The **chi-square distributions（卡方分布）** are a family of distributions that take **only positive values** and are **skewed to the right**. A particular $\mathcal{X}^2$ distribution is specified by giving its **degrees of freedom（自由度）**.

The $\mathcal{X}^2$ test for a two-way table with $r$ rows and $c$ columns uses critical values from the $\mathcal{X}^2$ distribution with **$(r – 1)(c – 1)$ degrees of freedom**.

The **P-value is the area under the density curve** of this $\mathcal{X}^2$ distribution to the **right（右尾）** of the value of the test statistic.

**Cell Counts Required（单元格数量要求）** for the Chi-Square Test
- The average of the expected counts is **$5$ or more**
- All individual expected counts are **$1$ or greater**
- In a 2 × 2 table, all four expected cell counts should be **at least 5**.

The **expected count** in any cell of a two-way table when $H_0$ is true is:

$$
\textbf{expected count} = \frac{\textbf{row total}\cdot\textbf{column total}}{\textbf{table total}}
$$

**Testing for independence（独立性检验）**
Suppose we have a single sample from a single population. For each individual in this SRS of size $n$, we measure two categorical variables. The results are then summarized in a two-way table.

The **null hypothesis** is that the **row and column variables are independent（零假设是行列无关/独立）**. The **alternative hypothesis** is that the **row and column variables are dependent（备选假设是行列相关）**.

### 9.2 Goodness of Fit

The idea of the chi-square test for goodness of fit is this: 
We compare the **observed counts** from our sample with the counts that would be **expected** if $H_0$ is true. 
The **more** the **observed counts** differ from the **expected counts**, the more evidence we have against the null hypothesis.**（比较观测值和预测值的差值，差值越大就越能对抗原假设）**

**E.g.**

A categorical variable has $k$ possible outcomes, with probabilities $p_1, p_2, p_3, \dots , p_k$. That is, $p_i$ is the probability of the $i^{\text{th}}$ outcome. We have $n$ independent observations from this categorical variable.

To test the null hypothesis that the probabilities have specified values:

$$
H_0: p_1, p_2, \dots, p_k
$$

find the **expected count** for each category assuming that $H_0$ is true. Then calculate the chi-square statistic:

$$
\mathcal{X}^2 = \sum\frac{(\textbf{observed} - \textbf{expected})^2}{\textbf{expected}}
$$

where the sum is over the $k$ different categories. The P-value is the area to the right of $\mathcal{X}^2$ under the density curve of the chi-square distribution with $k-1$ degrees of freedom.
