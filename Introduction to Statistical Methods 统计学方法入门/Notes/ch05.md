## Chapter 5: Sampling Distributions

### 5.1 The Sampling Distribution of a Sample Mean

**Mean of a sampling distribution of a sample mean**:
There is no tendency for a sample mean to fall systematically above or below $\mu$, even if the distribution of the raw data is skewed. Thus, the sample mean is an **unbiased estimate（无偏估计量）** of the population mean $\mu$. 

$$
\hat{\mu} = \mu
$$

**Standard deviation of a sampling distribution of a sample mean**:
The standard deviation of the sampling distribution measures how much the sample statistic varies from sample to sample. It is smaller than the standard deviation of the population by a factor of $\sqrt{n}$.

$$
s_x = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

**The Central Limit Theorem（中心极限定理）**:
Draw an SRS of size $n$ from any population with mean $μ$ and standard deviation $σ$. The **central limit theorem (CLT)** says that when $n$ is sufficiently large, the sampling distribution of the **sample mean is approximately Normal**, specifically,

$$
\bar{X}\sim N(\mu, \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}})
$$

### 5.2 Sampling Distributions for Proportions

Choose an SRS of size $n$ from a population with $p$ as the true proportion of success $→$ it follows that the population standard deviation is $\sigma = \sqrt{p(1-p)}$
- The mean of the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ is $\mu_{\hat{p}} = p$
- The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ is $\sigma_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{p(1-p)/n}$

As **$n$ increases**, the sampling distribution **becomes approximately Normal**.

For sufficiently large $n$:

$$
\hat{p}\sim N(p, \sqrt{p(1-p)/n})
$$
