## Chapter 8: Inference for Proportions

### 8.1 Inference for a Single Proportion

We can construct a confidence interval for an unknown population proportion $p$:

$$
\textbf{statistic} \pm (\textbf{critical value}) \cdot (\textbf{standard deviation of statistic})
$$

The sample proportion $\hat{p}$ is the statistic we use to estimate $p$. When the independent condition is met, the **standard deviation** of the sampling distibution of $\hat{p}$ is:

$$
\sigma_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}
$$

Since we don’t know $p$, we replace it with the sample proportion $\hat{p}$. This gives us the **standard error (SE)** of the sample proportion:

$$
\textbf{SE} = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}
$$

Once we find the critical value $z^*$, our **confidence interval for the population proportion $p$** is:

$$
\hat{p} \pm z^*\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}
$$

The z statistic has approximately the standard Normal distribution when $H_0$ is true. P-values therefore come from the standard Normal distribution. Here is a summary of the details for a **$z$ test for a proportion**, to test the hypothesis $H_0: p = p_0$, compute the $z$ statistic:

$$
z=\frac{\hat{p}-p}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}}
$$

To do Normal calculations, the sample size value should **at least $10$**.

**margin of error**:

$$
m = z^*\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}
$$

To **determine the sample size $n$** that will yield a level $C$ confidence interval for a population proportion $p$ with a maximum margin of error, solve the following:

$$
n = \left( \frac{z^*}{m} \right)^2p^*(1-p^*)
$$

where $p^*$ is a **guessed value for the sample proportion**. The margin of error will always be less than or equal to $m$ if you take the guess $p^*$ to be $0.5$.

### 8.2 Comparing Two Proportions

Sampling distribution of $\hat{p_1}-\hat{p_2}$, its standard deviation is:

$$
\sigma_{\hat{p_1}-\hat{p_2}} = \sqrt{\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}}
$$

Because we don’t know the values of the parameters $p_1$ and $p_2$, we replace them in the standard deviation formula with the sample proportions. The result is the **standard error** of the statistic $\hat{p_1} - \hat{p_2}$:

$$
\textbf{SE} = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p_1}(1-\hat{p_1})}{n_1} + \frac{\hat{p_2}(1-\hat{p_2})}{n_2}}
$$

When the **Random** and **Normal** conditions are met, an approximate level $C$ confidence interval for $(\hat{p_1} - \hat{p_2})$ is:

$$
(\hat{p_1} - \hat{p_2}) \pm z^* \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p_1}(1-\hat{p_1})}{n_1} + \frac{\hat{p_2}(1-\hat{p_2})}{n_2}}
$$

- **Random**: The data are produced by a **random sample** of size $n_1$ from Population 1 and a **random sample** of size $n_2$ from Population 2 or by two groups of sizes $n_1$ and $n_2$ in a randomized experiment.
- **Normal**: The counts of "successes" and "failures" in each sample or group——$n_1\hat{p_1}$, $n_1(1-\hat{p_1})$, $n_2\hat{p_2}$ and $n_2(1-\hat{p_2})$ are **all at least $10$**.

**Significance Test（显著性测试）** for Comparing Proportions: To do a test, standardize $\hat{p_1} - \hat{p_2}$ to get a $z$ statistic:

$$
\begin{align}
    \textbf{test statistic} &= \frac{\textbf{statistic} - \textbf{parameter}}{\textbf{standard deviation of statistic}} \nonumber\\
    z &= \frac{(\hat{p_1} - \hat{p_2}) - 0}{\textbf{standard deviation of statistic}} \nonumber
\end{align}
$$

This **pooled (or combined) sample proportion** is:

$$
\hat{p} = \frac{\textbf{count of successes in both samples combined}}{\textbf{count of individuals in both samples combined}}
$$

To test the hypothesis $H_0: p_1 − p_2 = 0$, first find the pooled proportion $\hat{p}$ of successes in both samples combined. Then compute the $z$ statistic:

$$
z = \frac{(\hat{p_1} - \hat{p_2})}{\sqrt{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})\left(\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}\right)}}
$$

Note that the **standard deviation of pooled sample** is:

$$
\sigma_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})\left(\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}\right)}
$$
