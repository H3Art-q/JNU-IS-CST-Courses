**16. The Inception phase is primarily concerned with detailed design specifications.**

> ❌

**17. Use cases should be derived from user stories and other relevant sources of information.**

> ✅

**18. The Inception phase is more than "a few" weeks long for most projects.**

> ❌

**19. Evolutionary requirements allow requirements to be refined based on iterative feedback.**

> ✅

**20. An actor in a use case diagram can represent both a human and an external system.**

> ✅

**21. In the Inception phase, it is important to identify risks that may impact project success.**

> ✅
