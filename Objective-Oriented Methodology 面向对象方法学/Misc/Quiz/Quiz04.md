**12. When are operation contracts most likely to be useful in the UP?**

> **A. For complex and subtle system operations**
> B. During inception
> C. For all system operations
> D. After the system is deployed

**13. What is the purpose of preconditions in an operation contract?**

> A. To describe the system architecture
> B. To list external actors
> **C. To define non-trivial assumptions before operation execution**
> D. To specify the system requirements

**14. Which of the following is a valid reason to update the domain model during contract creation?**

> A. To add unnecessary details

**15. What does the term "black box" refer to in the context of SSDs?**

> A. External actors interacting with the system
> B. The system's internal architecture
> **C. The system as a whole, without showing its internals**
> D. The domain model

**❌16. What is the primary difference between a system operation and a method?**

> **A. Methods handle messages, while system operations handle events**
> B. System operations are part of the public interface, while methods are private
> C. System operations are abstract, while methods are concrete
> D. Methods are implemented, while system operations are not
>
> Correct Answer: C

**17. In the example SSD for "Process Sale," which event initiates the sale?**

> **A. makeNewSale**
> B. makePayment
> C. endSale
> D. enterltem

**18. What is the main advantage of using SSDs over detailed use case descriptions?**

> A. SSDs enforce a strict format
> B. SSDs are easier to create

> A. Occurrence specifications
> B. Fragment markers
> **C. Combined fragments**
> D. Interaction frames
>
> Correct Answer: D

> **A. To provide detailed explanations of artifacts**
> B. To store system operation contracts
> C. To define system requirements
> D. To track system bugs

**21. SSDs are a detailed visual representation of the system's internal architecture.**

> ❌

**22. SSDs are generated from inspection of use cases.**

> ✅

**23. SSDs should show all scenarios of a use case, not just the main success scenario.**

> ❌

**24. The UML defines a specific type of diagram called a "system sequence diagram."**

> ❌

**25. Postconditions describe actions to be performed during an operation.**

> ❌

**26. Operation contracts are typically written during the inception phase of the UP.**

> ❌

**27. SSDs are useful for understanding the interface and collaborations of existing systems.**

> ✅

**28. It is recommended to include use case text directly in SSDs.**

> ❌

**❌29. The UML defines operations using pre- and post- conditions.**

> ✅
>
> Correct Answer: ❌

**30. System operations handle input system events, just as methods handle messages.**

> ✅

**31. The primary input to creating SSDs is the domain model.**

> ❌

**32. Contracts are never necessary for understanding the details of a system operation.**
