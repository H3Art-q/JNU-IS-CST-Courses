**6. The Hollywood Principle states:**

> **A. Don't call us, we'll call you**

**19. The sort() method in the Java Arrays class is:**

> **A. A static method**
> B. An abstract method
> C. A concrete method
> D. A hook method

**20. Which of the following best describes the Facade Pattern?**

> A. It allows objects to be created without specifying their concrete classes.
> B. It ensures that a class can only have one instance.
> **C. It provides a simplified interface to a subsystem.**
> D. It wraps an object to add new responsibilities.

**❌21. The DuckAdapter class converts a Duck object to a Turkey object.**

> ❌
>
> Correct Answer: ✅

**22. The Principle of Least Knowledge guides us to reduce the interactions between objects.**

> ✅

**23. The Factory Method Pattern is a specialization of the Template Method Pattern.**

> ✅

**24. The Principle of Least Knowledge prevents objects from interacting with too many other objects.**

> ✅

**25. Both object adapters and class adapters can be implemented in Java.**

> ❌

**26. In the Duck sorting example, the Ducks must subclass the Arrays class to be sorted.**

> ❌

**❌27. The Facade Pattern encapsulates the subsystem classes from direct access.**

> ✅
>
> Correct Answer: ❌

**28. The Template Method Pattern is not commonly found in real-world code.**

> ❌

**30. The boilWater() method is defined as abstract in the CaffeineBeverage class.**

> ❌
