- **Scenario testing** is an approach to release testing where you write a story describing how a system may be used and design tests based on the sequence of events in the scenario.
- **Sociotechnical systems** is/are self-aware and include defined operational processes and procedures.
- **Availability** is the ability of a system to deliver services when requested.
- Requirements expressed as scenarios, **Pair programming**, and test-first development are three important characteristics of extreme programming.
- **User requirements** are statements in a language that is understandable to a user of what services the system should provide and the constraints under which it operates.
